<font face="Arial">

1966 saw the introduction of the new Spider to replace the then ageing 
Giulietta Spider.

Designed and built by Pininfarina and based on the Giulia 105 series chassis (with a shorter wheelbase than the 
Coupé),
it was powered by the same 109bhp 1570cc dohc engine as in the GTV
coupé. Unnamed at launch, 'Duetto' was chosen as the name after a
write-in competition in Italy.
It featured a relatively sparse interior, with two bucket style seats,
a manual soft top and rubber floor mats (albeit with Alfa Romeo logos!)
together with a typically 'Italian' driving position. Two large
circular dials in front of the driver were complemented by three
smaller angled guages on the central dashboard. The price was 2,195,000
lire.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">1967 witnessed the introduction of
the
1750 Spider Veloce, powered by a 1779cc dohc with 118bhp. In Europe
this
was fitted with two twin carburettors, models sold in the US had
mechanical
fuel injection by Spica. Modifications were also made to the
suspension,
brakes, electrics and wheels and tyres. Visible differences were
limited to a slightly different grille and the front repeaters which <img src="logo\spider_kamm.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo 1750 Spider Veloce" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="406">
moved ahead of the wheelarches. The official title was 1750 Spider
Veloce, the name 'Duetto' being dropped from this point onwards.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">1967 also saw the 1600 Spider cease
production, whilst a new Spider 1300 Junior, with a 1290cc engine and
89bhp, was introduced in 1968. This lacked various features, including
the plastic headlight fairings, the brake servo, the hub caps, opening
quarterlight etc.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">In 1969 the first significant change
to the styling was introduced on the 1750 Spider Veloce. The round tail
was changed to a Kamm style
cut-off tail, which arguably made the car look more modern, and
certainly improved the luggage space. Numerous other small changes both
inside
and out, such as new doorhandles, a more inclined windscreen,
top-hinged pedals and improved interior trim were also made. </font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\spider_83rubbertail.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Spider Quadrifoglio Verde (1986)" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="393">
A new engine, the 1962cc engine producing
132bhp as in the coupé, arrived in 1971 to make the 2000 Spider Veloce.
Visually this remained unchanged from the 1750, apart from the name
badge. The 1750 car was gradually withdrawn from production, the final
examples emerging in 1972.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The 1600 Spider restarted production in 1972 as the Spider 1600 Junior, visually identical to the 1300 car.

</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">In 1974 the 1300 car gained two 'occasional use'
seats behind the front seats, becoming a two plus two. The same
modification was made to the 2000 in the following year.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The 1300 car ceased production in 1977, with the 1600 and 2000 cars continuing.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The next major restyling arrived in
1983. Not universally praised, it saw the introduction of black rubber
bumpers front and rear, with the former incorporating <img src="logo\spider1990_front.jpg" alt="Spider 2.0 (1990)" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="336">
the new (black rubber) grille and the latter blending into a
wrap-around rear spoiler, still the same black rubber. Various minor
modifications were made at the same time. These changes were made to
both the 1600 and 2000 cars which continued mechanically unchanged, the
1600 car dropping the 'Junior' tag.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">In 1986 the Spider 2.0 Quadrifolgio Verde (Green
Cloverleaf) was introduced, with aesthetic tweaks including sideskirts,
mirrors and new front and rear spoilers. The original cars remained in
production alongside this new entry. For the US market, this new car
became the standard, and sole, version.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The final major change came in 1990
with another significant facelift. Mechanically little changed, but
visually the car got another tail, this time with a lighting unit
stetching across the entire tail (matching that of the 164) and colour coded plastic bumpers. Inside various 
improvements were made at the same time.

<b><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="+3">Alfa Romeo Mi.To</font></b>
<p><img src="logo\mito_1.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Mi.To" align="right" border="1" height="220" width="424">

<font face="Arial">

Early 2008 saw the first images of the long awaited spiritual successor to the being revealed online. A compact, highly entertaining to 
drive, hatchback, the MiTo takes styling cues from the  whilst using a modified version of the 
Fiat Grande Punto</a> chassis. 

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The first car to be designed after the
8C, the MiTo carries several of the characteristic features of that
car, especially the side windows, the nose with its central grille and
two lower side intakes, and the circular LED rear lights. A compact
car, just over 4m in length, this has been used as an advantage in that
it allows a very rigid chassis to be constructed, with an exceptional
torsional stiffness of 101200daNm/rad. Aerodynamically, the significant
amount of theoretical and wind-tunnel work has paid off, with an
excellent Cd of just 0.29.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">In terms of <b>engines</b>, the MiTo
at launch (depending on market) offers a choice of five. Using petrol
there is a naturally aspirated 78bhp 1.4 8v engine, a 16v version with
95bhp and a turbocharged 16v version of the same with 155bhp. The
diesel options are a 1.3 16v MultiJet with 90bhp and the latest 1.6
JTDm common-rail turbodiesel with 120bhp and 320Nm of torque. All
engines drive through manual six-speed transmissions.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\mito002.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Mi.To" align="left" border="1" height="220" width="293">
An interesting feature of MiTo is the so-called <b>DNA system</b>.
This is an advanced, switchable form of dynamic control system with
three selectable modes. The 'Normal' mode is intended for relaxed,
urban driving; 'Dynamic' is optimised for sports driving, and 'All
Weather' ensures full control of the car in low-grip conditions.
When a mode is selected, the Alfa DNA System adapts all aspects of the
car and indicates the choice that&#8217;s been made with three
different-coloured LEDs and a signal on the control panel. The DNA
system acts on the steering wheel, on the VDC/braking system and on the
engine management systm. It changes their response, sensitivity and
performance, signaling each change on the instrument panel.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The Normal mode is ideal for getting
around the city and for relaxed, everyday driving. In this set up the
individual components in the Alfa DNA System are configured normally.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The Dynamic mode is optimised for
sportier driving, and offers a very different driving experience due to
the fact that the DNA makes the VDC and the ASR less intrusive,
partially freeing up the MiTo from electronic control of the vehicle
dynamics. At the same time it activates the Electronic Q2, the
electronic LSD software ar the front. This mode also acts on the
steering and the engine, the steering becomes less power-assisted to
give a sportier feeling while the throttle becomes more responsive and
the 155bhp petrol and 120bhp JTDM diesel engines can also draw on
over-boost.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\mito2.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Mi.To" align="right" border="1" height="220" width="443">When
All Weather is chosen on the DNA selector, the car is set up so that it
guarantees the driver the maximum control over the vehicle, even in
low-grip conditions, such as on the wet or snow. When this is
activated, the Alfa DNA System makes the car more easily controlled
even on low-grip surfaces by acting on the vehicle&#8217;s dynamic control
and lowering the VDC intervention threshold. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">In terms of <b>safety</b>, the Mi.To
has been designed to be one of the safest cars in Europe, and its
safety features have also been 'future proofed'. At the end of 2008 the
current Euro NCAP crash test ratings &#8211; which certify car safety - are
changing, and the Mi.To has been designed to score as highly as
possible under the new system.
The Alfa MiTo comes with seven airbags as standard, a double
pre-tensioner on the front seatbelts, an anti-whiplash device on the
seats, a collapsible steering wheel in case of head-on collisions, and
SBR (Seat Belt Reminder) technology.
This last feature comprises five sensors on a small screen on the
windscreen which detect whether all the passenger belts - both front
and rear - are fastened. The system is extremely rigorous and sends out
an acoustic signal should any of the passengers not have fastened their
belt.
The Alfa Mi.To promises maximum safety both for passengers and for
pedestrians. This result has been achieved by designing the bumpers so
they can pass rigorous tests and also by optimizing the exterior
components in order to avoid any possible injury to pedestrians&#8217; legs. </font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\mito001.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Mi.To" align="left" border="1" height="220" width="332">
Internally, the MiTo was designed by Centro Stile and is heavily
focussed around the driving position, with carefully positioned seat,
steering wheel, pedals and instruments. The atmosphere is typically
Alfa Romeo with a selection of styles available, mostly red or black
(there is also on blue) and heavily featuring finishes which reflect
the sporty aspirations of the brand, such as titanium, carbon-fibre and
leather. The sporty instruments are illuminated in either red or white,
depending on the version. The standard car is a four-seater (although
the 5th seat is an option in some markets). To ensure interior comfort,
a dual-zone automatic climate control system is available, as are
heated seats and a BOSE sound system.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">With regard to <b>telematics</b>, the
Fiat Group has been pushing ahead, and the MiTo offers all its options
- Blue&amp;Me (hands-free phone and USB port for MP3 music players),
Blue&amp;Me Nav (which adds a pictogramme navigation system using the
instrument panel display) and Blue&amp;Me Map (which uses a dashtop
mounted removable colour display). All come with voice control, whilst
Blue&amp;Me Nav also offers SOS and INFO services via roof mounted
button which call a central callcentre.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The range depends upon each market,
but the fundamental factory produced options at launch consisted of two
trim levels each with its own dashboard and seat trims, plus two
special packs which offer additional seat trims. </font></p>

<b><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="+3">Alfa Romeo Spider &amp; GTV</font></b>
<p><img src="logo\gtv_press.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo GTV" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="354"><font face="Arial">The
GTV coupe and Spider convertible were launched at the Geneva Motorshow in March 1995, after a long period
where Alfa Romeo had no real sporting models in its range. Really the spiritual
successors to the Betone GTV coupés
and the Duetto Spider respectively, both were
designed in-house at Alfa Romeo (with some assistance from Pininfarina).

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The chassis is originally based on the Tipo
platform but is heavily modified with MacPherson strut front and an all
new multilink rear suspension. The latter mounts the suspension onto a
light alloy subframe which in turn is bolted to the car. Through
careful design of geometry and bush compliance a small amount of rear
wheel steer has also been included. This results in exceptional
handling, which has been praised by many journalists, a factor
which is further improved through the use of a very quick steering
rack, with just 2.1 turns lock to lock.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\spider002xx.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Spider" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="402">
Power came from any of the following;
a 1747cc twin spark 16V (144bhp), a 1970cc twin spark 16V (155bhp), a 1996cc
V6 turbo (200bhp) or a 2959cc V6 (12V with 192bhp or 24V with 220bhp).
The latter was the fastest production Alfa Romeo to date when new.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The GTV accomodates two (plus two!),
whilst the Spider is strictly for two. The open topped car features a
folding soft-top, with a five hoop frame, which completely disappears
from site under a flush fitting cover. An electric folding mechanism is
fitted on some versions. As would be expected the GTV has
a much more rigid chassis, although considerable work was
(successfully) done to ensure that the Spider does not suffer from
scuttleshake. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">A mid-life update in 1998 is recogniseable
by the addition of a chrome rim around the Alfa shield in the bonnet, whilst
a more significant change was the addition of an (optional) six-speed gearbox
for the 3.0 24V version. Various other details were changed and the cockpit
was slightly redesigned.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">More significantly facelifted versions
of both the Spider and GTV were relased at the Geneva Motorshow 2003.
Both got a much deeper 147-style front grille, whilst the GTV also
gained a significant power boost with the addition of a a 240bhp
3.2-litre 24V V6 engine. A variety of detail modifications were also
carried out to the interior, suspension etc.

<b><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="+2">Monoposto</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">A one-off prototype for a racing car, the
Monoposto was effectively a modified Spider, fitted with the 3.0 V6
from the GTV. Modified aerodynamics saw (apart from the removale of the
windscreen) a new front and rear bumper, as well as a rigid (albeit
removable) tonneau hiding a rather small passenger seat. Other touches
included a 70's prototype style rear-view mirror and an F1 style in-car
camera. Various options were studied, including producing a kit for
existing Spiders, a limited run for a one-make series and others, but
in the end it remained a single prototype.

</p><p><img src="logo\gtv_press2.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo GTV" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="239"><font face="Arial">Easily
carried out modifications include installation of a free-flow air filter
(a cold air duct is also a worthy mod) and fitment of a less restrictive
exhaust system to improve the driveability, 'Chips' are also available
which (claim to) increase the power, driveability and torque all at the
same time. There are also companies offering such accessories as traction
control and launch control, and for those desiring yet more power, 3.5
litre conversions.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The brakes can be improved by using a higher specification fluid, fitting drilled
and grooved discs, using a superior pad compound and fitting stainless
steel braided flexible hoses.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Dampers and springs are readily available
for the Spider and GTV which will improve the handling, and a strut brace
can be fitted at the front to increase the stiffness of the bodyshell. The rubber 
bushes can also be replaced by items made from less compliant material.</font>

your nearest Alfa Romeo dealer....
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">As well as all the normal checks, look
particularly at the following :
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">1. Uneven tyre wear at the front (especially
inner the edges) which usually indicates that the tracking will need readjusting
(relatively inexpensive).
<br>2. Uneven tyre wear at the rear (accompanied
by a knocking noise) can indicate loose suspension bolts (rear link).
<br>3. Correct funtioning of the air-conditioning (if fitted).
<br>4. Ensure you get the brown 'master' key
in case you lose the others.</font>
