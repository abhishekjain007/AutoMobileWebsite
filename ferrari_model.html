The first ever Ferrari with a front mounted V8, the California is also
the first Ferrari to have the now-popular folding metal roof. The
official pre-launch press release from early 2008 read as follows :
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>"

NEW FERRARI CALIFORNIA REVEALED: A HUGELY VERSATILE, INNOVATION-PACKED GT
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>The Ferrari California joins the Prancing Horse&#8217;s 8-cylinder family which has always
been defined by power and performance. It also flanks the flagship 612 Scaglietti in the
prestige sporty Grand Tourer segment.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>The new Ferrari California will satisfy even the most demanding of owners in term of its
superb vehicle dynamics and driving pleasure. The new model will be available
exclusively as a convertible with a folding hard top. Both chassis and bodywork are
aluminium, in line with the rest of the current range. The California will be powered by
a new V8 engine mounted for the first time in the marque&#8217;s history in the mid-front
position.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i><img src="logo\california_2.jpg" alt="Ferrari California" width="413" align="left" border="1" height="200">
In line with Ferrari tradition, the new model also features several innovations. Apart
from its folding hard top, these include the original 2+ concept which guarantees
exceptional versatility of use in the rear of the car. The California&#8217;s 4,300 cc V8 engine
features direct fuel injection and a &#8220;flat&#8221; crankshaft. It generates 460 CV at 7,500 rpm
with a torque curve that enhances vehicle dynamics and provides maximum driving
pleasure which is typical for Ferrari.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>As per the traditional Ferrari transaxle layout, the engine, which allows the Ferrari
California to sprint from 0 to 100 km/h in less than 4.0 seconds, will be coupled to a
7-speed dual clutch transmission that boosts the car&#8217;s performance while enhancing the
driving pleasure, improves ride comfort and reduces fuel consumption and emissions
(c.310 g/km CO2). The comfort is further enhanced by a new multilink rear suspension
system. The Ferrari California is also equipped with the exclusive F1-Trac traction
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i><img src="logo\california_3.jpg" alt="Ferrari California" width="450" align="right" border="1" height="200">
control system which made its debut on the 599 GTB Fiorano and has been further
honed to suit the typical driving conditions expected for this new GT. Brembo brakes
featuring carbon-ceramic material disks as standard guarantee superbly efficient
braking.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>In addition to sporting the marque&#8217;s classic styling cues, the cabin has also been
beautifully trimmed using quality materials by Ferrari&#8217;s own skilled artisans. New
accessories and equipment, such as the seats, steering wheel, instrument panel and
infotainment system, together with optimised aerodynamics ensure that this is a highly
ergonomic and enjoyable car to drive regardless of whether the top is up or down.
The Ferrari California is aimed at owners who desire a car which embodies everything
the Prancing Horse represents in terms of sporty design and innovation, but also seek a
car with greater versatility than ever

<title>Information on the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano</title>

<b><font size="+3" color="red" face="Arial">Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano</font></b>


<p><img src="logo\599_1x.jpg" alt="Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano" width="359" align="right" border="1" height="200">

<font face="Arial">


The new two-seat classic front-engine rear-wheel-drive Ferrari, to replace the 575M, known as the 599 GTB Fiorano, was revealed 
to the world at Geneva in early 2006. 
Fiorano after the circuit Ferrari uses to hone the performance of its 
track and road cars; GTB as in Gran Turismo Berlinetta; and 599 to 
reflect the displacement of its V12 engine divided by 10.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">An all new all-aluminium two-seater,
it is, as usual, designed by Pininfarina. Significant testing in the
wind tunnel concentrated on downforce and drag. The optimisation of the
Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano's underbody, the rear diffuser and external
form resulted in an aerodynamic load of just 160 kg at 300 km/h,
whilst, the Cd (drag coefficient) is just 0.336.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano is an
exceedingly sculpted car, where every new angle brings something new to
light, carefully combining sportiness and elegance. Internally, there
is a balance between the car's sporty vocation and the feeling of
intimacy and safety that skilled hand-crafting and detailed
personalisation provide. The passenger areas of the car are trimmed in
luxury leather while the driver area and controls use more high-tech
carbon-fibre and aluminium detailing. <img src="logo\599_5x.jpg" alt="Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano" width="346" align="left" border="1" height="200">
The central rev counter can have a red or yellow background, there is a
central grip to provide extra support for the passenger and new
adaptive racing seats feature carbon-fibre side rests. Other standard
features include front bi-xenon headlamps and rear LED lights, dusk and
rain sensors, dual-zone climate control, electrically adjustable
steering-wheel column, hideaway radio/CD player and key with integrated
volumetric anti-theft device with motion sensors. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">Technically, the specifications of the engine are outstanding: 5999 cm3 displacement, with a 
specific power output of 103bhp/litre. Chain driven twin overhead camshafts per cylinder bank feature continuously 
variable timing on both inlet and exhaust cams to optimise torque delivery and drivability at both low and high revs. A 
twin-plate, low inertia clutch helps lower the centre of gravity. The Fiorano's engine 
delivers a maximum torque of 608 Nm at 5,600 rpm and pulls well at all engine speeds. Its 
maximum power output is 620 hp at 7,600 rpm with a maximum engine speed of 8,400 rpm. Particular attention was also paid 
to fuel consumption which is the same as in the previous model, under similar use, despite a significant leap in 
performance. Development work for the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano also focused on the distinctive sound the engine 
makes, both to enhance driving pleasure and also to provide a quieter ride inside the cabin itself.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\599_4x.jpg" alt="Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano" width="395" align="right" border="1" height="200">

The new generation F1 gearbox that made its debut on the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano is a further development of the 
F1 gearbox used on all of the models in the Ferrari range. The F1-SuperFast system enhances the car's high-performance 
capabilities by using the elastic energy within the transmission components, together with the integrated 
electronic engine and gearbox management programmes, to speed up gear change times. The various stages involved in changing 
the gears are implemented in parallel (non-sequentially) and this results in exceptionally fast gear shifting. In fact, it 
cuts overall gear-shift times to just 100 ms. 

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The new electronic control systems result in easier, smoother high-performance driving, thanks to maximum grip out of bends 
(a 20% increase in acceleration compared to a traditional traction and stability control system) and predictable 
handling even in extreme situations. The F1-Trac is integrated adapts the car's behaviour to the 
driving conditions: the Sport setting provides the best balance between stability and performance on the road while 
Race ensures clients maximum performance combined with consistently brilliant handling.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\599_6x.jpg" alt="Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano" width="453" align="left" border="1" height="200">

The 599 GTB Fiorano uses a new magnetorheological (MR) suspension system. Unlike traditional systems, this 
reacts instantly to road conditions and driver inputs, thanks to the fact that the dampers use a fluid the viscosity of 
which is modified by applying an electronically controlled magnetic field. What this means in practice is greatly 
improved body control which in turn directly improves handling and road-holding due to optimal tyre grip in all road 
conditions. The result is a much safer and more enjoyable driving experience courtesy of reduced roll and greater 
control when accelerating, braking and cornering.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The steering wheel-mounted vehicle dynamics control switch, originally developed for the 1996 Formula 1 season, 
has been taken a step further for the new Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano. This integrates the stability and F1-Trac 
traction control systems, the F1-SuperFast gearbox and the SCM (Magnetorheological Suspension Control) fluid suspension. This 
means that the driver can select the correct setting for the grip conditions at any given time. Readouts 
are displayed on the new on-board Multi Display unit so that the information for specific setting is 
instantly available to the driver (e.g. lap times, tyre temperature and pressure or trip computer readouts.)

<b><font size="+3" color="red" face="Arial">Ferrari F40</font></b>
<p><img src="logo\f40front3.jpg" alt="Ferrari F40" width="354" align="right" border="1" height="200">
<font face="Arial">Designed to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of Ferrari, the F40 was
duly revealed to the world at the Frankfurt Motorshow in September 1987. It was designed and engineered
to be the nearest thing to a race car on the road, and offered a performance
to match its heritage.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The engine and chassis were (very) loosely
based on those of the 288GTO. The former was
a 2936cc development of the V8, still with four valves per cylinder and
twin IHI turbos, but now generating 478bhp. The compression ratio was a
modest 7.8:1 but the boost pressure used was a less than modest 16psi.
The chassis retained the wheelbase and basic suspension arrangement, double wishbones front and rear, of
the 288GTO but featured wider tracks front and rear. The wheels were immense
17 inch Cromodara units, 13 inches wide at the rear and shed with 335/35
Pirelli P-Zero tyres (8 in at the front with 245/40). Due to the extremely
small ground clearance on some cars the suspension featured a switchable
height control.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\f40_open.gif" alt="Ferrari F40" width="379" align="left" height="183">
The body which hid the tubular steel frame was a completely new design, as
usual by Pininfarina. Using carbon-fibre, kevlar, aluminium and honeycomb
parts it was aerodynamic, functional and light . These aims were further
aided by the use of plastic for all the windows bar the windscreen, early
cars with fixed side windows and later ones with manually wound items.
Numerous ducts and vents were provided to cool the brakes and engine, and
feed the turbos, as well as keep the car on the road, the latter also being
helped by the large rear aerofoil. It was assembled by hand, the resulting
quality of the construction being one of the few (or only!) areas of the
car which was sometimes criticised.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Few compromises were made, with no
power steering and pull-cords to open the door from the inside,
everything was done to keep it light. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">Initial plans to build just 400 were modified
several times, until a total of 1,315 cars had been built.
